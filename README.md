# Editing this README

When you're ready to make this README your own, just edit this file and use the handy template below (or feel free to structure it however you want - this is just a starting point!). Thanks to [makeareadme.com](https://www.makeareadme.com/) for this template.

## Name
Strudel REPL Experiments is a repository for JavaScript based Studel REPL scripts intended for use on [Strudel REPL](https://strudel.cc).

## Description
The individual files on this repository are meant to either be copy/pasted to the editing window for Live Music Coding, or playback, or possibly to import as sample waveforms for further manipulation and sequencing within the Strudel REPL interface.

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Support
Go to [Strudel REPL](https://strudel.cc) for documentation, examples, and a primer on how to use Strudel REPL for sequencing, waveform manipulations, etc., in a syntax based on JavaScript. The service is free. I believe it's also possible to run Strudel REPL locally, though I haven't looked into it yet.

## Contributing
You are welcome to fork and reuse these code blocks however you like. I would love it if you would keep any headers that include author credit or URLs pointing to sources. But the Live Coding community encourages use and reuse so we can all develop good talent and methodologies.

Please do respect other authors' licenses and desires for credit and attribution.

## Authors and acknowledgment
Just me so far. Other example files will be credited to the DJs and artists who created them, and include URLs where appropriate to point you back to them.

## License
You may freely reuse and remix anything I have created here. Please look into other authors' works for their licenses. As much as possible, I will try not to reuse others' unless there is explicit permission to do so.

## Project status
This repository/project is active as of August 2025. We'll see how long the fascination lasts.
