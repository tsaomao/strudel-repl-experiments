# Samples
DJ creation, including tasks, mixing, remixing, tweaking, sampling, and sequencing are wildly creative practices that often rework other practicing DJs' and producers' work. We share, we try to share respectfully, and learn from each other, constantly innovating and riffing off of others' ideas.

Part of that work is sampling.

Since I'm new here, I'll try to create my own samples, or maybe use freely given libraries of samples, in my own work. But it's up to you.

## Licensing
Everything I create and share here I give freely. Feel free to use it as you see fit. If I catch you do fascist shit with it, I'll sabotage you any way I can. Be warned.
